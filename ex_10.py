# This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.

# Take two lists, say for example these two:

# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). 
# Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Write this using at least one list comprehension. (Hint: Remember 
# list comprehensions from Exercise 7).

    a = []
    b = []

    for i in range(0,9):
